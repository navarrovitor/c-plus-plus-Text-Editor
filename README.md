C++ text file editor
<br>
This is a project that turns a text file into a doubly linked list. You can then read it in a doubly linked list format, count how many times a word appears, and swap any word you like to the one of your preference. In the end, it lets you save your changes into your previoulsy loaded file.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

If you're using linux, I suggest you to create a makefile so you can compile all the files and run main.cpp. I used this template:

```
all:
	g++ main.cpp Node.cpp LinkedList.cpp -o LinkedList && ./LinkedList
```
